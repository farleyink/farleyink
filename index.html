    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>Michael Adam Farley was born in California, raised on a Colorado mountainside, and came of age after his family moved to Tennessee. After becoming an adult, he moved just north of the Tennessee border and settled down in a little Kentucky town named Guthrie (just down the road from the home of America's first poet laureate, Robert Penn Warren). His life, being more colorful than this alone, created a patchwork of landscapes and cultures which left their imprint on his storytelling: bold, unconfined, and deeply human.</p>
    <p>He doesn't write by genre, rather, he writes by spark. One story might follow a lawyer fighting a broken system, another, a cowboy recovering from a life-altering injury, and another still, a Deaf Cherokee woman who can see and hear the dead. His works are filled with heart, wit, and the kind of emotional depth that lives on long after the last page is past. Whether it’s dragons, aliens, or a student body fighting for their identity and voice, Adam’s characters are always wrestling with real questions, and as part, so are his readers.</p>
    <p>He began writing as a teenager, driven by curiosity and a vivid imagination. Early works were shared among friends who demanded more, sensing the raw, emotional pull of his voice. Life, however, as it does, had other plans—school, family, career. Writing was paused. But in 2025, amidst the requirements of doctoral studies, fatherhood, and running a hearing health business, something in him stirred. The stories came crying out for an audience, louder, stronger, refusing to stay locked away any longer. And finally, he listened.</p>
    <p>Adam writes, not simply to be read, but to be felt. His stories aren’t always heartwarming, but they always have heart. Heroes aren’t always obvious. Villains may not even exist. Sometimes, there are just people who are broken, searching, and rising.</p>
    <p>When he's not writing, Adam is busy raising three incredibly dynamic kids, working on his doctorate, and building his hearing care practice. He loves exploring lost or hidden places, spelunking, savoring delicious foods, raising trees that bring forth fruit, shaping the trees into art expressions, and serving in his community. His years of volunteer service include the Tennessee State Guard, the Civil Air Patrol, and his church.</p>
    <p>His stories may be conceived by him, but they will live on in you. He realized, after decades of living, that they are not just for him. They’re for you. And once you've read them, he hopes you’ll never experience life quite the same again.</p>
